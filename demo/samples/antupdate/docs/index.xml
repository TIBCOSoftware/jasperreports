	<!--
The JRXML files represent the source files for static report templates. These report templates need to be 
prepared for use at runtime by compiling them into <code>*.jasper</code> files, which are basically serialized 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JasperReport.html">JasperReport</api> objects, ready for filling with data.
<br/>
<br/>
Report template source files having the <code>*.jrxml</code> file extensions are compiled into serialized object files 
having the <code>*.jasper</code> file extension, just like Java source files having the <code>*.java</code> file extension 
are transformed into Java bytecode binary files with the <code>*.class</code> file extension.
<br/>
The transformation of <code>*.jrxml</code> files into <code>*.jasper</code> files should be part of the application 
build process, just as the compilation of <code>*.java</code> files into <code>*.class</code> files is.
In the majority of cases, when the report templates are static and do not change at runtime (only data feed into them changes), 
there is no point in deploying source JRXML files  with the application.
<br/>
After all, when deploying a Java application, you deploy <code>*.class</code> files, packaged up in JARs, not source <code>*.java</code> files. 
The same technique is applicable to JR report template files, where compiled <code>*.jasper</code> files should be created 
at application built time and then deployed as part of the application classpath as resources.
<br/>
<br/>
The JasperReports library provides a built-in Ant task for compiling source JRXML report template files into <code>*.jasper</code> files. 
This task is represented by the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/ant/JRAntCompileTask.html">JRAntCompilerTask</api> task and 
works very similar to the Ant built-in <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/javac.html">Javac</a> task.
<br/>
<br/>
This task scans source folders and looks up for report template files (usually having the JRXML file extension) 
and compiles them into <code>*.jasper</code> files which are placed into a destination folder hierarchy.
<br/>
The destination folder tree is similar to the source folder tree, meaning that the relative location of source files from 
the root source folder is preserved for the resulting <code>*.jasper</code> files.
<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the <code>Javac</code> task, the source folders can be specified using either the <code>srcdir</code> attribute 
of the task (when there is only one root source folder) or using a nested <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> tag (when source files 
are scattered across multiple paths).
<br/>
<br/>
Open the <code>build.xml</code> file in the current sample and notice how the custom Ant task called <code>jrc</code> is defined:
<br/>
<br/>
<pre><![CDATA[
<taskdef name="jrc" classname="net.sf.jasperreports.ant.JRAntCompileTask"> 
  <classpath refid="classpath"/>
</taskdef>
]]>
</pre>
This task definition uses a <code>&lt;classpath&gt;</code> element which contains the JasperReports JAR and all its required dependencies.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, the custom <code>jrc</code> task is used to compile report templates having the <code>*.jrxml</code> file extension found under 
the sample's <code>reports</code> folder. This source folder is specified using the <code>srcdir</code> attribute of the <code>jrc</code> task 
in the <code>compile1</code> target of the <code>build.xml</code> file:
<br/>
<br/>
<pre><![CDATA[
<target name="compile1"> 
  <mkdir dir="./build/reports"/> 
  <jrc 
    srcdir="./reports"
    destdir="./build/reports"
    tempdir="./build/reports"
    keepjava="true"
    xmlvalidation="true">
   <classpath refid="runClasspath"/>
   <include name="**/*.jrxml"/>
  </jrc>
</target> 
]]>
</pre>
The <code>compile2</code> target in the same <code>build.xml</code> file performs the same report compilation process, 
but the source folder is specified using a nested <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> tag with filesets. The nested source tag allows compiling report 
templates that are scattered through many different locations and are not grouped under a single root report source folder.
<br/>
<br/>
<pre><![CDATA[
<target name="compile2">
  <mkdir dir="./build/reports"/> 
  <jrc 
    destdir="./build/reports"
    tempdir="./build/reports"
    keepjava="true"
    xmlvalidation="true">
   <src>
    <fileset dir="./reports">
     <include name="**/*.jrxml"/>
    </fileset>
   </src>
   <classpath refid="runClasspath"/>
  </jrc> 
</target> 
]]>
</pre>
Notice that both report compilation targets have a <code>&lt;classpath&gt;</code> nested element, used to specify the classpath used by the report 
compiler. This so called run-classpath contains classes that are referenced inside the report templates themselves, such as scriptlet classes, 
chart customizers and so forth.
<br/>
In this particular sample, both source JRXML files make use of such helper classes found in the <code>src</code> folder of the samples. 
These helper classes have to be compiled before the report templates are compiled, using the <code>javac</code> target of the <code>build.xml</code> file.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the <code>srcdir</code> and the <code>destdir</code> attributes, the <code>jrc</code> custom Ant task shipped with JasperReports 
supports the following attributes:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><code>compiler</code> : Name of the class that implements the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/design/JRCompiler.html">JRCompiler</api> interface to be used for compiling the reports (optional).</li>
<li><code>xmlvalidation</code> : Flag to indicate whether the XML validation should be performed on the source report template files (<code>true</code> by default).</li>
<li><code>tempdir</code> : Location to store the temporarily generated files (the current working directory by default).</li>
<li><code>keepjava</code> : Flag to indicate if the temporary Java files generated on the fly should be kept and not deleted automatically (<code>false</code> by default).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
In our sample, we use the default report compiler, which is the JDT-based compiler, because the JDT JAR is found in the classpath. 
This compiler works on the assumption that report expressions are Java expressions and thus it produces a Java class file dynamically containing 
all the report expressions and compiles it using the JDT Java compiler. Normally, this report compiler does all the Java class file generation 
and compilation in-memory and does not work with actual files on disk, which makes it very flexible and easy to deploy in all environments. 
However, if the <code>keepjava</code> flag is turned to <code>true</code>, it will save the report's temporary Java source file on disk, 
in the specified <code>tempdir</code>. This is useful for debugging report expressions in certain cases.
<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the report expression language they are mapped to, other report compiler implementations might produce script files instead of Java files, 
for report expression evaluation. The <code>keepjava</code> and the <code>tempdir</code> attributes will still work for them, except that the files 
that will be kept into the temporary location will not be Java source files but script files, also helpful for debugging.

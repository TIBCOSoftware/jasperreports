    Once a report is created the next challenge is to make this available to your report users. This sample <br/>
	reviews embedding a JasperReports template into a Java Application.<br/>
	The technology used are simple Servlets and JSP.<br/>
	This sample also demonstrates:
	<ul>
		<li>Configuring and using several of the JasperReports exporters</li>
		<li>Viewing a report in Flash</li>
		<li>Viewing a report in an Applet</li>
		<li>Creating and using an XML Datasource</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>Setting Up The Sample</b>
	<i>Prerequisites</i><br/>
    Ant is required. By running 'ant --version' you will be able to check if ant is set up on your system (at least version 1.5 is required):<br />
    <pre>
    <![CDATA[
    C:\>ant -version Apache Ant version 1.8.0 compiled on February 1 2010
	]]>
	</pre>
	You can obtain ant from http://ant.apache.org/, instructions for installation can be found there as well.
	<br/>
	Also before generating this sample you will need to run the jar ant command in the build file at the <br/>
	in the root of the project. This will generate JasperReports jar files in the dist directory of the root <br/>
	level. These jars are using in the web app sample, the sample will not function without them.
	<br/>
	 <i>Generating the Application</i>
    <br/>
    Open up a separate command prompt/terminal window and browse to the root directory of the sample.
    <br/>
    By running 'ant -p' you will be presented with a list of options available. Of interest in this list is all the exporters available for testing.
    <br/>
    By running the command 'war' the following actions will be performed:
    <br/>
    <ul>
    <li>All the dependancies will be copied to the WEB-INF\lib directory</li>
	<li>All required Java classes will be compiled</li>
	<li>The dependancies, class files and any other files will be packaged into a war file</li>
    </ul>
	The war file will be generated in the root level of the project. This file can be deployed in a Java application server such as Tomcat (simply place<br/>
	the file in the webapps folder and restart the server).
    <br/>
    You now have a working version of the app you can review.

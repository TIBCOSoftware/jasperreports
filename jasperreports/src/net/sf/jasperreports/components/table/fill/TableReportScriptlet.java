/**
 * This scriptlet implementation for table component ended up not being used as a scriptlet,
 * because its prior technique to detect the presence of at least one detail band on the page
 * was not accurate in case the detail was overflowing onto the new page.
 * 
 * Its current technique uses a flag in the report filler to detect the presence of a detail band
 * and thus this scriptlet implementation itself is only used as a vehicle to add a built-in parameter
 * to the table component subreport, to give access to the filler and its internal the flag.

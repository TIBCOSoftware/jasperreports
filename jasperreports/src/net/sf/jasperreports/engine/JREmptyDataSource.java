/**
 * A simple data source implementation that simulates a data source with a given number of virtual records inside.
 * It is called empty data source because even though it has one or more records inside, all the report fields
 * are null for all the virtual records of the data source.
 * <p>
 * The simplest implementation of the {@link net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JRDataSource}
 * interface, this class can be used in reports that do not display data from the supplied data
 * source, but rather from parameters, and when only the number of virtual rows in the data
 * source is important.

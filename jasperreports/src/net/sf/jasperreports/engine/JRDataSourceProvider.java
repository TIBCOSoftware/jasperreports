/**
 * Abstracts the means of creating and disposing a data source. 
 * This interface is meant to be the standard way to plug custom 
 * data sources into GUI designers. Typically the report developer will 
 * implement this interface to create and return a configured data source 
 * of the desired type and then configure the designer to use this implementation. 
 * <br>
 * The following example demonstrates a provider for a 
 * {@link net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.JRBeanCollectionDataSource JRBeanCollectionDataSource}.
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * public class MyBeansDataSource extends JRAbstractBeanDataSourceProvider {
 * 
 * 	public MyBeansDataSource() {
 * 		super(PersonBean.class);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public JRDataSource create(JasperReport report) throws JRException {
 * 		ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
 * 		list.add(new PersonBean("Teodor"));
 * 		list.add(new PersonBean("Peter"));
 * 		return new JRBeanCollectionDataSource(list);
 * 	}
 *	
 * 	public void dispose(JRDataSource dataSource) throws JRException {
 *		// nothing to dispose
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>

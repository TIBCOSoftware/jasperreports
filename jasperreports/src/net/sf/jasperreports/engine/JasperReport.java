/**
 * Instances of this class represent compiled report template objects. They are obtained only 
 * through the JasperReports report compilation process and are ready to use for filling with 
 * data and report generation. 
 * <p>
 * Through compilation, along with various consistency checks and rearrangements of the 
 * report elements for more rapid performance in the application, the library creates an 
 * on-the-fly class file (or a script, depending on the type of the report compiler used) 
 * containing all the report expressions (such as report variables expressions, text field and 
 * image expressions, and group expressions). This class or script is used to evaluate report 
 * expressions during the report-filling process at runtime. 
 * </p><p>
 * The main difference between a compiled report and a report design is that
 * reports are already compiled and validated, so many characteristics are read only.

<b>Exporter Input</b>
<br/>
<br/>
The input data for an exporter comes in the form of one or more JasperPrint 
documents that must be exported to some other document format. These JasperPrint 
objects may be already in memory, come from the network through an input stream, or 
reside in files on disk. 
<br/>
An exporter should be able to handle such a wide range of document sources. In fact, all 
the exporter implementations that are shipped inside the library already do this. They all 
extend the <code>net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JRAbstractExporter</code> class, which 
holds all the logic for dealing with the source documents that need to be exported inside 
its defined <code>setInput()</code> method. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Batch Mode Export</b>
<br/>
<br/>
The first thing an exporter needs to know is whether it is acting on a single 
JasperPrint document or a list with several such generated documents. Exporting 
multiple JasperPrint objects to a single resulting document is called batch mode 
exporting.
<br/>
Not all exporters can work in batch mode, but those that do first look into the supplied 
parameter values to see whether a <code>java.util.List</code> of JasperPrint object has been 
supplied to them using the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRExporterParameter.html#JASPER_PRINT_LIST">JASPER_PRINT_LIST</api> exporter parameter. If so, the exporter 
loops through this list of documents and produces a single document from them.
<br/> 
If the exporters act on a single document, then they check whether a value is supplied to 
the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRExporterParameter.html#JASPER_PRINT">JASPER_PRINT</api> parameter, representing a single in-memory JasperPrint document 
that must be exported. If no value is found for this parameter, then the input for the 
exporter is a single JasperPrint document to be loaded from an input stream, an URL, 
a file object, or a file name. The exporter checks the following exporter parameters in 
this exact order, stopping at the first that has a non-null value: <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRExporterParameter.html#INPUT_STREAM">INPUT_STREAM</api>, 
<api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRExporterParameter.html#INPUT_URL">INPUT_URL</api>, <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRExporterParameter.html#INPUT_FILE">INPUT_FILE</api>, 
and <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JRExporterParameter.html#INPUT_FILE_NAME">INPUT_FILE_NAME</api>. If it does not find any of these 
parameters being set, then the exporter throws an exception telling that no 
input source was set for the export process.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Batch Mode Bookmarks</b>
<br/>
<br/>
When several JasperPrint documents must be concatenated in the same PDF file by 
batch export, you can introduce PDF bookmarks in the resulting PDF document to mark 
the beginning of each individual document that was part of the initial document list. 
<br/>
These bookmarks have the same name as the original JasperPrint document as 
specified by the <code>jasperPrint.getName()</code> property. However, users can turn on and off 
the creation of those bookmarks by setting the <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/export/JRPdfExporterParameter.html#IS_CREATING_BATCH_MODE_BOOKMARKS">IS_CREATING_BATCH_MODE_BOOKMARKS</api> 
exporter parameter to Boolean.TRUE or Boolean.FALSE. The exporter does not create 
such bookmarks by default. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Running the Sample</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Running the sample requires the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> library. Make sure that <code>ant</code> is already installed on your system (version 1.5 or later).
<br/>
In a command prompt/terminal window set the current folder to <code>demo/samples/batchexport</code> within the JasperReports source project and run the <code>&gt; ant test view</code> command.
<br/>
It will generate all supported document types containing the sample report in the <code>demo/samples/batchexport/build/reports</code> directory. 
<br/>
Then the report will open in the JasperReports internal viewer.

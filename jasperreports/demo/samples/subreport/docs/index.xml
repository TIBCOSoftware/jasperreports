<b>What is a Subreport</b><br/>
A Subreport is a JasperReports Template thats embedded within another JasperReports template (which we will refer to as the Master report).
<br/>
As the Master report executes, each time the Subreport element is reached it is executed and its content seamlessly embedded into the output of the Master report.
<br/>
The end result is a single output containing the blended contents of the Master report and each subreport execution.<br/>
Subreports can be nested.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>When to Use Subreports</b><br/>
There are several situations when you wish to embed one report into other. Examples of such situations are:
<ul>
	<li>Isolating a common layout that is used in a series of reports</li>
	<li>Processing records from a query different from the Master report's query</li>
</ul>
This current example demonstrates the latter case.
<br/>
<br/>
    <b>Running the Sample</b>
    <br/>
    <i>Prerequisites</i><br/>
    Ant is required. By running 'ant --version' you will be able to check if ant is set up on your system (at least version 1.5 is required):<br />
    <pre>
    <![CDATA[
    C:\>ant -version Apache Ant version 1.8.0 compiled on February 1 2010
	]]>
	</pre>
	You can obtain ant from http://ant.apache.org/, instructions for installation can be found there as well.
	<br/>
	<br/>
    <i>Starting the Data Source</i>
    <br/>
    In a command prompt/terminal window browse to the demo/hsqldb folder of the JasperReports source and run the command 'ant runServer'.
    <br/>
    Leave window/terminal running (see below for sample output).
    <br/>
    <pre>
    <![CDATA[
    C:\js-workspace\jasperreports\demo\hsqldb>ant runServer
	Buildfile: C:\js-workspace\jasperreports\demo\hsqldb\build.xml

	runServer:
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: [Thread[main,5,main]]: checkRunning(false) entered
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: [Thread[main,5,main]]: checkRunning(false) exited
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: Startup sequence initiated from main() method
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: Loaded properties from [C:\js-workspace\jasperreports\demo\hsqldb\server.properties]
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: Initiating startup sequence...
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: Server socket opened successfully in 19 ms.

     [java] [Server@83cc67]: To close normally, connect and execute SHUTDOWN SQL
     [java] [Server@83cc67]: From command line, use [Ctrl]+[C] to abort abruptly
    ]]>
	</pre>
    <i>Generating the Report</i>
    <br/>
    Open up a separate command prompt/terminal window and browse to the root directory of the sample.
    <br/>
    By running 'ant -p' you will be presented with a list of options available. Of interest in this list is all the exporters available for testing.
    <br/>
    Each export type will generate a output type in the build/report folder.
    <br/>
    By running the command 'ant' the following actions will be performed:
    <br/>
    <ul>
    <li>All java code will be compiled to produce class files.</li>
    <li>JRXML fills will be compiled by JasperReports to produce a .jasperfile (this is a serialized version of a JasperReports object).</li>
    <li>The report will be filled with data and the resulting object, JasperPrint, will be serialized to the file system as a .jrprint.</li>
    <li>All the exporters the sample is configured to test will run.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    You can now run 'ant view' to see a version of the report in the JasperViewer (an applet contained in the JasperReports package which can be used to view a .jrprint object).
    <br/>
    Each of the these task can be ran separately as well:
    <br/>
    <ul>
    	<li>ant clean - removes all generated files.</li>
    	<li>ant javac - compiles all java code, this should be done before running further tasks.</li>
    	<li>ant compile - compiles the JRXML generating a .jasper file.</li>
    	<li>ant fill - fills the report with data, some reports use the empty data source, others use the HSQL DB and other an inline data source. A .jrprint object is generated in this step.</li>
    	<li>ant view - opens the report in the JasperViewer</li>
    	<li>ant pdf - generates a PDF (other exporters are available run 'ant -p' for a full list)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Note:</b> All generated files can be found in build/reports.
    <br/>
    You now have a working version of the report you can review.
    <br/>
	<br/>
<b>Configuring a Subreport</b> <br/>
The first thing to note is any JasperReport can be used as a Subreport. However, once a report has embedded into another as a Subreport, the Master report is now responsible for:
<ul>
	<li>Supplying the Subreport with a JRDataSource</li>
	<li>Specifying an expression to locate the report design</li>
	<li>Passing Parameters into the Subreport</li>
</ul>
The Subreport can return data to the main report using variables.
<br/>
In this example the Master Report contains the Address and Product reports embedded as Subreport elements.
<br/>
Lets begin by review the configuration of the Subreport element for the Products Subreport.
<pre>
	<![CDATA[
<subreport>
	<reportElement isPrintRepeatedValues="false" x="5" y="25" width="325" height="20" isRemoveLineWhenBlank="true" backcolor="#ffcc99"/>
	<subreportParameter name="City">
		<subreportParameterExpression><![ CDATA[$F{City} ]] ></subreportParameterExpression>
	</subreportParameter>
	<connectionExpression><![ CDATA[$P{REPORT_CONNECTION}]] ></connectionExpression>
	<returnValue subreportVariable="PriceSum" toVariable="ProductTotalPrice" calculation="Sum"/>
	<subreportExpression class="net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JasperReport"><![ CDATA[$P{ProductsSubreport}]] ></subreportExpression>
</subreport>
	]]>
</pre>
This element is in the Detail band of the Master report. This means this Subreport will be executed with each record in the Master report's Result Set.
<br/>
<br/>
<i>subreportParameter</i><br/>
This tag indicates a Parameter in the Product report is being filled by the Master report. In this case, its the City field in the Master report<br/>
filling the City Parameter of the Product report.<br/>
If we look at the query of the Product report we see that the value of the City parameter is injected into the Query to constrain the Results:
 <pre>
 	<![CDATA[
SELECT Product.ID AS ID, Product.Name AS Name, 
Positions.Quantity AS Quantity, Positions.Price AS Price
FROM Positions, Product, Document, Address
WHERE Positions.DocumentID = Document.ID AND
Document.AddressID = Address.ID AND
Positions.ProductID = Product.ID AND
Address.City = $P{City}
ORDER BY Product.ID
 	]]>
 </pre>
 What this means is the Product report executes for each row in the Master report's ResultSet and displays results related to the city field in that row <br/>
 (Remember: Fields map to the data source, in this case to columns returned in the Result Set).<br/>
 For more information on modifying report queries please view the <a href="../query/index.html">Query Sample</a>.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <i>connectionExpression</i><br/>
 This tag specifies the JRDataSource to be used to fill the subreport. In this case the built in parameter $P{REPORT_CONNECTION} is used.<br/>
 This parameter contains a reference to JDBC Connection that was used to fill the Master Report. This is best practice when working with Subreports <br/>
 which need to be filled with the same JDBC Connection as the Master report.<br/>
 In situations where your Subreport doesn't use a data source (the report may just contain some text and/or images) a reference to the<br/>
  JREmptyDataSource can be passed in here:
<br/>
<pre>
	<![CDATA[
<dataSourceExpression><![ CDATA[new net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JREmptyDataSource()]] ></dataSourceExpression>
	]]>
</pre>
 <br/>
 <i>returnValue</i><br/>
 This tag indicates the value passed from the subreport to the Master report. The calulcation indicates if the value should be accumlated or just passed directly up.<br/>
 In this case the calculation is Sum, meaning the PriceSum variable in the Subreport is going to be accumlated for each Subreport execution and stored in the <br/>
 ProductTotalPrice variable of the master report. If the desired effect is to just pass a variable from the Subreport to the Master, then a calculation type of <br/>
 None should be used.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <i>subreport Expression</i><br/>
 This tag indicates where the design of the Subreport can be located. Note the class. In this example the expression is returning a JasperReports object.<br/>
 The subreport expression represents a very powerful place for extensions/integratoins. Ternary operators can be used here to load different Subreports based on different <br/>
 conditions in the report. Also external Java classes can be called in this expression, provided they return a JasperReport reference, the subreport design can be obtained <br/>
 or created using Java. In the SubreportApp.java the JasperReport reference is obtained by loading a .jasper (serialized JasperReport object) file from the file system. 
 <pre>
 <![CDATA[
 JasperReport subreport = (JasperReport)JRLoader.loadObjectFromLocation("build/reports/ProductReport.jasper");
 ]]>
 </pre>
 Lets review the Address Report configuration.<br/>
 <pre>
 	<![CDATA[
<subreport>
	 <reportElement positionType="Float" x="335" y="25" width="175" height="20" isRemoveLineWhenBlank="true" backcolor="#99ccff"/>
	 <subreportParameter name="City">
	   <subreportParameterExpression><![ CDATA[$F{City}]] ></subreportParameterExpression>
	 </subreportParameter>
	 <connectionExpression><![ CDATA[$P{REPORT_CONNECTION}]] ></connectionExpression>
	 <returnValue subreportVariable="REPORT_COUNT" toVariable="CityAddressCount"/>
	 <subreportExpression class="java.lang.String"><![CDATA["AddressReport.jasper"]] ></subreportExpression>
</subreport>
	]]>
 </pre>
 The main differences are here:
 <ol>
 	<li>returnValue: No calculation is set. The default is None, which means the variable REPORT_COUNT variable in the subreport will be passed directly to the Master.</li>
	<li>subreportExpression: In this case the expression class is a String and the expression is the location on the file system for the compiled version of the JRXML.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Is there performance concerns with Subreports?</b><br/>
The answer to this depends on your system, data source and your report design. A few points to note on Subreports:
<ul>
<li>Each subreport execution may spawn a new thread (see below).</li>
<li>As the subreport executes more objects will be created in Heap Memory.</li>
</ul>
On the subject of threads. Support for Java continuations has been added as an alternative to threads. This was done using the Jakarta Commons Javaflow library.<br/>
The JasperReports property: net.sf.jasperreports.subreport.runner.factory can be used with the following two settings:
<ul>
	<li>net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRContinuationSubreportRunnerFactory</li>
	<li>net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRThreadSubreportRunnerFactory</li>
</ul>
By default net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRThreadSubreportRunnerFactory is used, however if net.sf.jasperreports.engine.fill.JRContinuationSubreportRunnerFactory<br/>
is set, then a Javaflow approach will be used to fill the reports rather than threads. If this option is choosen, then the Jakarta Commons Javaflow jar must be<br/>
included in the application classpath. This jar can be found in the lib directory of the JasperReport reports project distribution package.<br/>
The jasperreports-javaflow.properties file illustrates how this property could be set in a actual implementation.<br/>
Other alternatives for processing different queries in the same report are usage of the <a href="../list/index.html">List</a> element and <a href="../charts/index.html">Sub Datasets</a>.

JasperReports 4.1.1 (2011-08-11, SVN 4550)
---------------------------------------------
- deprecated code for JRReportFont, JRBox, graphic element pen property
and all deprecated byte-based properties were removed from the library's API;

- the whole JR source code was overhauled to make use of Java5-style Generics;

- value class property is now deprecated in expression objects; the type of
expression no longer needs to be specified;

- the library's API was extended with a new repository API, which is used now
throughout the reporting engine to locate report resources such as images, fonts, 
subreports, etc; 

- new parameter contributor interface was added to the engine to allow parameter
manipulation prior to query execution; parameter contributors can be plugged in as
extensions;

- new data adapter concept was added to the library's API to allow the reporting engine
to connect to data directly, without the parent application providing the data the source 
nor the query executer parameters, at report fill time;

- new report executing servlet was added as part of a larger Web framework that
is now available in the library's core API, to simplify deployment of JR inside
Web applications and achieve higher degree of interactivity for reports;
details about how this new Web framework can be used can be seen in the new
/demo/samples/webapp-repo sample, which also makes use of the newly introduced
repository API, to locate the report templates and their additional resources;

- the table component was enhanced so that it is more interactive by default,
when the reports are deployed in an application that makes use of the above mentioned
Web framework; by default, table columns are sortable, while text columns are filtrable
using a simple "contains" filter criteria; this can be seen in the TableReport
deployed in the /demo/samples/webapp-repo sample;

- new map component added to the core library to simplify rendering of Google maps
inside reports;

- new XLS metadata exporter added, similar to the CSV metadata exporter in which
columns that need to be exported have to be marked-up using configuration properties 
at text element level;

- new XLSX data source and query executer added; details about how it works 
are found in the new /demo/samples/xlsxdatasource sample;

- pattern expression added to text fields elements to allow for more flexible
dates and numbers formatting;

- custom property "net.sf.jasperreports.export.xls.pattern" is now available to control
cell formatting patterns in XLS/XLSX exporters;

- new custom properties are available in XLS/XLSX exporters to freeze panes;

- new "net.sf.jasperreports.image.dpi" custom property added to allow specifying 
the image resolution in dots-per-inch, for the images created by the engine when 
rasterizing SVGs or when clipping other image renderers;

- the "net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.force.linebreak.policy" configuration property
is now deprecated as the PDF text rendering code was refactored so that text is rendered 
exactly like in AWT;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;
